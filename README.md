# Java Array Manipulation Programs

This repository contains various Java programs for array manipulation, including sorting, rearranging positive and negative numbers, finding duplicates, and more. These programs are designed to help solve common array-related problems efficiently.

## Features
- Sum of elements in an array
- Reverse an array
- Rotate an array (left or right)
- Find duplicates in an array
- Count occurrences of a specific element
- Merge and sort two arrays
- Find the second largest number in an array
- Rearrange positive and negative numbers alternately

## Technologies Used
- Java
- Arrays, Loops, Conditional Statements

## Installation Instructions
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
   ```

2. Open the project in your favorite IDE (e.g., IntelliJ, Eclipse).
3. Compile and run the Java programs.

## Usage
You can find different programs under the `src/array` directory. Each file contains a specific array-related problem, such as:

- `sumOfArrayIndex.java`: Calculates the sum of array elements.
- `reverseArray.java`: Reverses the elements of an array.
- `removeDuplicates.java`: Removes duplicates from a sorted array.
- `rearrangeArray.java`: Alternates positive and negative numbers.

Run any of these programs using your Java compiler or IDE.
